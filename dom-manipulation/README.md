# DOM Manipulation, Web Storage, and Working with JSON Data
This project helps you develop a dynamic web application using advanced DOM manipulation techniques, web storage, and JSON data handling. Skills gained include:
- Create and manipulate dynamic content using JavaScript.
- Persist data across sessions using local and session storage.
- Import and export JSON data to manage application state.
-Implement a dynamic content filtering system.

## Learning Objectives:
By the end of this project, skills gained are:-
- ### Utilize Advanced DOM Manipulation Techniques:
- Create and manipulate dynamic content in a web application using JavaScript.
- Implement event-driven programming for interactivity.
- ### Implement and Use Web Storage:
- Use local and session storage to persist data across browser sessions.
- Save, retrieve, and manage data stored in the browser.
- ### Handle JSON Data:
- Import and export JSON data to and from web storage.
- Manage JSON data effectively within a web application.
- ### Filter and Sync Data:
- Implement content filtering based on user criteria.
- Simulate data syncing with a server and handle potential conflicts (advanced).

## Tasks:
### 1. Building a Dynamic Content Generator with Advanced DOM Manipulation 
This task introduces dynamic content generation based on user interactions. You'll build a "Dynamic Quote Generator" that allows users to view random quotes and add new ones.

### 2. Implementing Web Storage and JSON Handling
Here, you'll enhance the quote generator by integrating local storage and JSON functionality. You'll be able to:
- Persist quotes across browser sessions using local storage.
- Import and export quotes in JSON format.

### 3. Creating a Dynamic Content Filtering System Using Web Storage and JSON.
This task focuses on implementing a filtering system based on categories stored in web storage. Users can filter quotes and the last selected category is remembered.

### 4. Syncing Data with Server and Implementing Conflict Resolution. 
This advanced task involves simulating server interaction and data syncing. Skills gained include;-
- Set up a mock server interaction to receive updates.
- Implement data syncing with conflict resolution strategies.
- Handle potential conflicts due to simultaneous edits.
